### Details
This is a regular workout tracker, made to track and chart workouts. It includes a main page to add a new workout or continue an existing one. Either option will allow you to add exercises, including details relevant to their type, and differentiation between cardio and resistance training. There is also a dashboard with charting information for the past 7 days.

* You can add exerises as you do them, or rack them all up at once. Your current workout will remain open until you choose to open a new one.

* The stats include several wonderful graphs and charts, provided by the course. My work on this app is strictly working with the server direction, and working out what I needed to add from the existing front-end. That said, they are quite lovely charts.


### Issues
While you can use this app to track quite reliably, there are a few features that could be improved with future iterations:

* More robust entry restriction may be desired. Listing existing exercises, rep ranges, and other details may form the groundwork for more detailed tracking.

* Currently, there are no options to edit or delete exercises once they are entered, nor to go back and edit an earlier workout session. No ragrets, as it were.
